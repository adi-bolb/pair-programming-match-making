#Day 1

##First session
###What we did
We created a startup application. We used Java with 
It took us 45 minutes

###Retrospective

####Good
Feel like moving forward
We had a chance to have three programmers during the first session
It compiles on both IntelliJ and Eclipse
A shaky start in the beginning, but we know what we are doing now

####Improvements
Let's focus more on the details
Already we have "lazy" code
We are focusing too much on HTML tags
Start asking some challenging questions, maybe during retrospective


##Second session
Discussed if we want to continue on horizontal slices or vertical slices of functionality. 
We created a new page where all the pairs that are searching for programmers to pair with are listed. We decided to have the list with the timeslots where each of the programmers are available. For each list item we added a button where one can notify a pair about a session.

####Good
Enjoyed to find what the application is about 
We are gaining context about what we are doing
The reals applications I like working in this way, it's not just getting the reuirements implemented, but also having flexibility to change things. Where we have enough we can add more from the features.
Less debate about the things we are doing

####Improvements
A little frustrating that we do not have functionality implemented
There is a lot of duplication in the HTML files
Let's focus on confirm/reject functionality and then we can have the basic functionality
Less emphasis on shortcuts. Don't tell shortcuts to people who are writing unless whoever is writing is not asking.
Write all the shortcuts on a whiteboard.
Felt we had less progress than in the first session


##Third session
We completed the user journey of a programmer to invite and the accept or reject the invitation.
We added a tag in github 'hardcoded-flow'

####Good
Finished hardcoding, we can get down to sending email
Making progress, working better. 
Even a short iteration, we did more
Working better with each others
Found something and immediately fixed it
Method naming got better
We were more focused

####Improvements
nothing to add... we were perfect

##Lunch
We came back after 1 hour and 22 minutes.

##Fourth session
We refactored the code and discussed about the design we need to follow

####Good
We made product
Some of the people did not feel included in the discussions
We changed a lot of things, we separated the things that did not belong together
We had rotation, around 4 people were at the keyboard

####Improvements
We should draw things when we are disagreeing
Focus more on finishing the first increment of the product
Too many people talked in the same time too often and we could not understand what we need to do next
We should have something we end so we could have a codebase we can start playing with
Try to do a 25' session

##Fifth session
Session was 25 minutes. We created first test for email.

####Good
Drawing helped, clarified and brought up discussion.
We started testing because we have behaviour now.

####Improvements
Driver was sitting 25 mintes, bad.
We avoid the domain, need to explore the domain.
25 minutes is too short. Try again 45 minutes.
Adi and Alex need to be more involved.
