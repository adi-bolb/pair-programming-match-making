#Day 1

##First session
###What we did
We created a startup application. We used Java with 
It took us 45 minutes

###Retrospective

####Good
Feel like moving forward
We had a chance to have three programmers during the first session
It compiles on both IntelliJ and Eclipse
A shaky start in the beginning, but we know what we are doing now

####Improvements
Let's focus more on the details
Already we have "lazy" code
We are focusing too much on HTML tags
Start asking some challenging questions, maybe during retrospective


##Second session
Discussed if we want to continue on horizontal slices or vertical slices of functionality.
